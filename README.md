# Zebra

Zebra is a C library that implements concepts of linear algebra.

## Why another library?

As I write this document, I find myself with a sudden interest to study linear
algebra, given my attempts to study machine learning. I believe that one retains
knowledge in bigger capacities when learning is combined with the application of
the acquired knowledge to achieve something. Therefore, I have chosen to write a
simple library in C that implements the algorithms and concepts I come across in
my journey to learn linear algebra.
